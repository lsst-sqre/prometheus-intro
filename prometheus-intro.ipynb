    "Prometheus is a pull-based monitoring system, which means that a Prometheus client exposes metrics via an HTTP endpoint, and the Prometheus server scrapes them periodically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prometheus support different [types of metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/). A \"metric value\" in Prometheus is called a sample. A single Prometheus server can ingest millions of samples per second. The result is a large number of stored time series, which are uniquely identified by a [metric name](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) and a set of labels. The Prometheus project implements its own Time Series DB and query language (PromQL) in Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PromQL query language supports several [operators](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#comparison-binary-operators), different types of [aggregations](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators) and [functions](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/) that can be applied to the time series.\n",

    "Alerting with Prometheus requires two steps, one is creating [alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) in PromQL and then configuring the [alert manager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/). \n",

    "Prometheus is largely used for infrastructure and application monitoring. The main reason we don't recommend it for LSST DM monitoring is because it is a pull-based monitoring system. Even if there are options like [PushGateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) for pushing metrics from short lived jobs to   an intermediary cahe which Prometheus can scrape, the time series resolution is fixed by the `scrape_interval` configuration. That doesn't fit well for SQuaSH and for the DM-EFD use cases where we want to collect, store and visualize eventually all \"metric measurements\"."
